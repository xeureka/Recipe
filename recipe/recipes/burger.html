    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <!-- desription -->
    <p>A burger, short for hamburger, is a classic and popular food item that consists 
        of a cooked ground meat patty sandwiched between two halves of a bun. The meat patty is typically made from ground beef, although variations with other meats or plant-based alternatives have become increasingly popular. Burgers are often seasoned with various spices and 
        can be cooked to different levels of doneness, ranging from well-done to rare.
        Burgers are typically served with a variety of toppings and condiments, such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese, pickles, ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. These toppings add flavor, texture, and freshness to the burger. Additional ingredients like bacon, avocado, mushrooms, or fried eggs can be added to create unique and customizable flavor combinations.

        Burgers are known for their versatility and are enjoyed in various styles and variations around the world. From classic cheeseburgers to gourmet creations with exotic ingredients, there is a burger to suit almost every taste preference. They are commonly served in restaurants, fast food chains, food trucks, and backyard barbecues, making them a beloved and iconic food choice for many people.
