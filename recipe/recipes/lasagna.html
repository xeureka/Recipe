    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is loved and enjoyed by people all over the world. It is a layered pasta dish that typically consists of wide, flat noodles, seasoned ground meat, tomato sauce, and a variety of cheeses. The layers of pasta are alternated with the meat sauce and cheese, creating a harmonious blend of flavors and textures. Lasagna can be customized to individual preferences by adding vegetables, such as spinach or mushrooms, or even substituting the meat with a vegetarian alternative. The dish is then baked in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly, resulting in a satisfying and comforting meal that is perfect for sharing with family and friends. Whether enjoyed as a main course or as a hearty side dish, lasagna never fails to delight with its rich and indulgent taste.
